MEMO #001
DATE: 23 February 2026
PAIRS: EUR/USD + USD/JPY
DATA SOURCE: FRED API + Yahoo Finance (pipeline.py) + CFTC COT Report
PIPELINE RUN: 2026-02-23, data as of 2026-02-20
COT DATA: CFTC Legacy Report, CME, Futures Only, as of 2026-02-17

NOTE ON DATA QUALITY: JP 10Y was initially sourced from OECD which returned 0.73%.
FRED has the correct value at 2.24% -- reflects BoJ rate hikes since 2024.
All numbers in this memo use the corrected FRED data. Earlier pipeline runs
had an overstated US-JP spread as a result. Fixed before this memo was written.

COT positioning (as of Feb 17, 2026):
EUR net speculative position:  +174,480 contracts (net LONG euro)
JPY net speculative position:  +12,955 contracts (net LONG yen)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SECTION 2 -- WHAT THE DATA PREDICTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The US-DE spread has narrowed by 1.04pp over 12 months -- from roughly 1.66%
to 0.62% today. The US yield advantage over Germany has compressed significantly.
Rate differential logic predicts: less incentive to hold dollars over euros,
capital flows back toward euros, EUR/USD should have risen.

EUR speculative positioning is net long 174,480 contracts -- heavily crowded.
This suggests the rate differential story is now consensus. When positioning
is this one-sided, the easy move is likely already priced in.

The US-JP spread has narrowed by 1.51pp over 12 months -- from roughly 2.70%
to 1.19% today. Japan has been hiking while US yields have fallen.
Rate differential logic predicts: USD/JPY should have fallen.

JPY speculative positioning is net long 12,955 contracts -- speculators are
now betting on yen strength, not weakness. The yen carry trade shorts that
existed through 2024 have fully unwound and flipped to a net long position.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SECTION 3 -- WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

EUR/USD -- PREDICTION CONFIRMED, BUT CROWDING IS A WARNING

EUR/USD rose +12.21% over 12 months. The US-DE spread narrowed 1.04pp over
the same period. Direction matches rate differential logic exactly -- as the
US yield advantage over Germany compressed, the incentive to hold dollars
weakened and EUR/USD appreciated.

The DXY falling 8.80% confirms this was broad dollar weakness, not just
euro strength. The spread compression story holds for direction.

However: the 174,480 net long EUR positioning is a warning signal. The move
is now crowded consensus. Speculative longs at this scale mean a lot of
buyers are already in the trade. Any negative surprise on ECB policy or
European growth could trigger a sharp unwind of these positions.

One anomaly: at least one period visible on the chart where EUR/USD dipped
despite stable spreads. Driver unknown -- could be risk-off, positioning
squeezes, or a policy statement. Flagged for future investigation.

USD/JPY -- RATE DIFFERENTIAL PREDICTION NOT CONFIRMED, CARRY HYPOTHESIS UPDATED

USD/JPY rose +4.25% over 12 months despite the spread narrowing 1.51pp.
Rate differential logic predicted the opposite.

The historical explanation: carry trade dynamics kept USD/JPY elevated through
2024 despite narrowing spreads. Funds borrowed cheap yen at near-zero rates
and invested in higher-yielding dollar assets, creating persistent yen selling
pressure beyond what the spread justified.

However, the COT data shows this carry trade has fully unwound. JPY positioning
has flipped from crowded short (the 2024 extreme) to net long 12,955 contracts
today. The BoJ hiking from near-zero to 2.24% made yen borrowing expensive
enough to close the carry trade, not just reduce it.

The partial pullback from 158 to 155 visible on the chart is consistent with
this unwind. USD/JPY did not collapse entirely because the BoJ is moving
gradually -- pausing at 0.75% overnight rate -- not aggressively hiking.

Current USD/JPY is being driven by BoJ rate expectations and risk sentiment,
not carry crowding. The carry risk is resolved for now.

Short-term note: this week USD/JPY rose +1.53% while EUR/USD fell -0.84%
and DXY gained +0.95%. Broad dollar strength in one week. Spreads barely
moved. Short-term driver is not rate differentials -- likely risk sentiment
or positioning flows. Cannot identify specific catalyst without news context.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SECTION 4 -- WHAT I CANNOT EXPLAIN YET
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. This week dollar strengthened broadly (DXY +0.95%) but spreads barely
   moved -- short-term driver unknown, not rate differentials

2. One EUR/USD dip visible on chart not explained by spread movement --
   specific date and driver not yet identified

3. DE and JP yields are monthly from FRED, not daily -- spread calculations
   between monthly updates carry stale yield data, known limitation

4. EUR net long positioning at 174,480 is crowded but no historical percentile
   context yet -- need to pull historical COT data to know if this is
   an extreme or just elevated. Will build automated COT pipeline next.

5. BoJ held overnight rate at 0.75% in latest statement with "remain" language
   -- no forward guidance on next move. Unclear if another hike is coming
   in 3-6 months, which would determine whether USD/JPY continues falling.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SECTION 5 -- WHAT I WILL DO NEXT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Build automated COT pipeline -- pull CFTC data weekly, add to master CSV
   alongside rate differentials. Calculate rolling percentile of net position
   to identify when positioning is at historical extremes.

2. Key question for EUR: is 174,480 net long a historical extreme? If yes,
   EUR/USD upside may be limited from here regardless of spread direction.

3. Key question for JPY: now that carry is unwound, what drives USD/JPY next?
   Track BoJ statements for forward guidance on rate path. If BoJ signals
   another hike, USD/JPY likely falls further as spread narrows more.

4. Start tracking the specific date of the EUR/USD dip anomaly and identify
   what event or data release caused it.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CONFIDENCE: Medium
REASON: EUR/USD rate differential story confirmed. COT shows crowded long
-- upside risk from here is limited. USD/JPY carry hypothesis confirmed
historically via COT, but current drivers are BoJ policy and risk sentiment,
not carry. Short-term dollar strength this week remains unexplained.

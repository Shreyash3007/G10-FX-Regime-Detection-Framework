COT CORRECTION NOTE:
Memo #001 used Legacy NonCommercial data (manual read).

  EUR: +174,480   JPY: +12,955

Disaggregated Leveraged Money (pipeline):
  EUR: +43,549    JPY: -29,321

Leveraged money is the correct series for regime detection.
All future memos use pipeline numbers.

OBSERVATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Two days since memo #001.
No meaningful change in spreads or positioning.  
Moved within normal daily range, no regime signal.

Current regime assessment unchanged:
  EUR/USD -- rate differential regime, crowded long, limited upside
  USD/JPY -- positioning partially unwound, BoJ path is key variable

OPEN QUESTION:
EUR at 97th percentile positioning -- how long can a crowded trade
stay crowded before it unwinds? What specific catalyst would trigger
the EUR long unwind? ECB policy shift? US data surprise?
